        <h1>Background</h1>
            <p>Dedicated in 1978 by President Spencer W. Kimball (1895–1985), the São Paulo Brazil Temple was the first temple built in South America. It was financed in part by the contributions of local members, many of whom did not have money to give. Instead they offered wedding rings, bracelets, medals, and other valuable personal objects.</p>

                <p>The temple is a modern, single-spire design. Its foundations are strong enough to sustain another 13 stories, making the structure virtually earthquake proof.</p>
                
                <p>The exterior was constructed of reinforced concrete faced with cast stone composed of quartz and marble aggregates. There are 3,000 exterior panels of 400 different sizes and shapes, fit perfectly in specific places on the temple walls because the space between panels could be no more than one millimeter.</p>
                
                <p>In 2004 the temple was rededicated following renovations, which included placing a figure of the angel Moroni atop the previously unadorned spire.</p>
            
        
        
            
            

            <h1>Things we do inside the temple</h1>
            <h2>Baptism for people who died without learning about the Gospel</h2>
            <div class="baptism">
            <p>The fourth Article of Faith states that the first ordinances of the gospel of Jesus Christ are “baptism by immersion for the remission of sins” and the “laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost.” The Savior taught that baptism and confirmation are essential for all who desire to follow Him and return to our Heavenly Father after this life.</p>

            <p>At the beginning of His ministry, Jesus traveled from Galilee to the Jordan River in Judea. John the Baptist was there, preaching about repentance and baptizing people. Jesus also asked to be baptized, but John was reluctant because he knew Jesus was without sin. The Savior explained that He needed to be baptized to “fulfil all righteousness” (Matthew 3:15) and be obedient to the commandments of our Heavenly Father. So Jesus Christ set the example for all of us when He entered the water and John baptized Him. John also received a personal witness of that sacred experience:</p>
                    
            <p>“And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him:</p>
                    
            <p>“And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased” (Matthew 3:16–17).</p>
                    
            <p>Later in the Savior’s ministry, a Jewish ruler named Nicodemus came to Him at night. He recognized that Jesus was “a teacher come from God” (John 3:2), and he wanted to learn more. Jesus taught him that both baptism and confirmation were necessary for salvation:</p>
                    
            <p>“Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God” (John 3:5).</p>
                    
            <p>Being “born of water” refers to baptism, and being “born of the Spirit” refers to receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost through confirmation. These ordinances are sacred, and we make solemn covenants, or promises, when we receive them. These covenants include being willing to take the name of Jesus Christ upon us, always remembering Him, and keeping the commandments of God. As we honor these commitments, we demonstrate our faith in Jesus Christ and our willingness to follow Him.</p>
                    
            <p>After His Resurrection, the Savior again taught the importance of baptism. He sent the Apostles forth to preach His gospel to all people, saying, “He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved” (Mark 16:16).</p>
                    
            <p>When the Savior restored His Church to the earth in modern times through the Prophet Joseph Smith, He reaffirmed that baptism is still necessary (see Doctrine and Covenants 22:4) and also revealed the proper method of baptism. He made it clear that the ordinance must be performed by one having proper priesthood authority and that it must be done by immersion (see Doctrine and Covenants 20:73–74).</p>
                    
            <h2>God Loves All of His Children</h2>
                    
            <p>Every person is a child of God. All are precious to Him. He knows them and He loves them. “For behold, this is my work and my glory,” He declared—“to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man” (Moses 1:39). He has provided a way for all of His children to return to Him after this life—that way is the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
                    
            <p>Many people have the opportunity to accept the gospel and be baptized while they are alive. But what about those who die without being baptized or even knowing about Jesus? How can they also be saved? God has not forgotten them!</p>
                    
            <p>Death is not the end of life, but rather a necessary step on our journey back to God. When we die, our spirits temporarily leave our bodies as we enter the spirit world and join family members and others who have also passed away. There we further prepare for that wonderful day when we will be resurrected and our spirits will be reunited with perfected bodies that are free from sickness, disease, and all the disabilities and weaknesses we currently endure. While in the spirit world, those who have died without the chance to learn about the gospel in this life are taught about the Savior and the plan of salvation (see 1 Peter 3:18–20; Doctrine and Covenants 138:16–19). They can then choose to accept the gospel and repent. However, they are not able to be baptized because they do not have their physical bodies. A merciful Heavenly Father has provided another way for them to receive baptism.</p>
                    
            <p>In the temple, we can perform the ordinances of baptism and confirmation in behalf of those who have died without that opportunity. In other words, we can represent them and act in their place. Ordinances performed in behalf of others are called proxy ordinances (or vicarious ordinances). As one of the many eyewitnesses of the risen Lord, the Apostle Paul taught the Corinthians that vicarious baptism for the dead was practiced because all people will be resurrected through the Atonement of Jesus Christ (see 1 Corinthians 15:29, 55–57).</p>
                    
            <p>The doctrine of vicarious ordinances has always been part of the gospel of Jesus Christ. In fact, His Atonement is the greatest vicarious act in the history of the world. Through His infinite sacrifice, He did for all people what we cannot do for ourselves. Because of Him, all people will be resurrected, all will hear the gospel, and all will have the opportunity to return to our Heavenly Parents.</p>
                    
            <p>Temple baptisms and confirmations performed for those who have died are gifts offered in love. And because we believe that life continues after death, we also believe that those who have died are aware of the ordinances and can choose whether or not to accept them.</p>
